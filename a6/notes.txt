1: write a complete TensorFlow model by selectively including parts of the two examples
2: generate a simple comparison of different learning models while varying two architectural features

mnist_ .py where team_name is something distinctive
it will log information to a directory using the TensorFlow summaries capability

include the use of layers and build a convolution neural network
	matching the structure of network from file cnn_mnist.py 
	also summaries capabilities

present results across at least eight different model variants. 
	size of the intermediate layers within your network, 
	the learning rate, 
	and the use of dropout

study the last portion of the video on YouTube describing the use of summaries
	comparative results from a number of different models into a format that is easily inspected using TensorBoard


one paragraph introduction, 
a section outlining your tuning experiment, 
	include one or more figures highlighting the salient findings relative to the different architectures and parameter settings examined
and a conclusion
	conclusion can be as brief as one paragraph or longer if you choose

<<<<<<< HEAD
in class:
	figure out if it's easy to put weights into summaries
