INTRO:

As opposed to directly combining the convolutional capabilities of the provided cnn_mnist.py and the TensorBoard summaries connection of mnist_summaries.py, we chose to use a TensorBoard tutorial program provided by Dandelion Man√© in his talk at the 2017 Tensorflow Dev Summit, titled "Hands-on TensorBoard". This program uses convolutional neural networks to solve the mnist classification problem in a similar manner to the approach taken in cnn_mnist.py.

We have made two<INCREASE IF NEEDED> major modifications:
1) We have added the capability to visualize the intermediate filter weights as images in tensorboard.
2) We have removed the embedded visualizer as we deemed it was not necessary for our model.
